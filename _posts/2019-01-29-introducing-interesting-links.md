## Interesting links #1

I will be posting series of interesting articles and posts from the internet once or twice a week on dated pages that have the title *Interesting links*.

The idea is to share interesting literature that I could explore in the time afforded to me. If you find anything that you feel strongly about, please feel free to reach out to directly at me@ishworgurung.com.

So, without further delay here is the first lot

[A New Golden Age for Computer Architecture](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/2/234352-a-new-golden-age-for-computer-architecture/fulltext)

[You're Doing It Wrong](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1814327) 

[How we spent two weeks hunting an NFS bug in the Linux kernel](https://about.gitlab.com/2018/11/14/how-we-spent-two-weeks-hunting-an-nfs-bug/)
