## WTF links #7

# TL;DR

Watch [Can strace make you fail? strace syscall fault injection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYMDzk6HYGU) by Dmitry Levin who is its current maintainer.

# Non TL;DR

I find myself needing to use `strace(1)` to debug stuffs a lot but recently, I found myself re-visiting it. Enter syscall tampering / fault injection - Youtube talk by Dmitry Levin [Fault Injection in strace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYMDzk6HYGU). 

The reason fault injection becomes a useful tool to have in the arsenal is because you may need to _dynamically_ inject error path into codes developed using Go / Rust / C (amongst the modern language ecosystem). With `strace(1)`, from the application's point of view, it is all as if Linux kernel handled the system call as per your application's need; where in-fact `strace(1)` dynamically instrumented the target syscall and _injected_ the fault for your application.

The alternative to `strace(1)` is a little costly - bcc/ebpf that need to be instrumented at compile-time (but bcc/ebpf is extremely powerful!) or *perf* (extremely heavyweight).

Until next WTF Links, keep testing injecting those faults in your code! :-)
