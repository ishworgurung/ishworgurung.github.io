## Hello!

I do *Software. UNIX. Distributed.*

You can find me drinking coffee, walking or playing clown with my daughter depending on the time of day. 

In the past life, I've been many things such as Web Application developer, DevOps, Backend developer, Information Security engineer/consultant and System administrator. In the past, I had the pleasure of making friends from all walks of life - high to low, north,south, east to west and west to east.. Good times.

These days, the times have changed and for good effing reason; It's definitely gottenbetter. I get paid to develop **amazing** software and work with a great team in the Sydney office.

As an engineer, I get to work on varied pieces of technologies; Some of the stuffs I deal on a daily basis include not just software development but maintaining edge infrastructure, deployment, containerisation, working with mammoth numbers of AWS ecosystem, Kubernetes clusters, performance and security of the software infrastructure.
